          Currently I am living in Kansas with my husband and two cats.  Cosima and Wednesday are sister cats who went from feral rescues,
          to lazy-pampered house cats.  I enjoy true crime podcasts, science fiction, fantasy, and thriller novels.  
          <br><br>
          I have a BA from Southern New Hampshire University in English.  I currently work as a Debit Card Fraud Case Processor, and have
           worked for my current company for the last three years.
